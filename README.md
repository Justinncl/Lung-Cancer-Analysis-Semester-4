<br/>

## ⌨️Languages:
- Python
  
<br/>

## 📖Library Requirements:
In order to perform data preprocessing in the .ipynb file, first install the following library requirements.

<br/>

## 🔎Analysis Flow:
1. Import required libraries
2. Load the Google Drive in which the dataset is located
3. Assign the designated dataset path in the Google Drive
4. Display the dataset content to ensure dataset has been loaded
5. Display the dataset information (Example: Columns, Data type, etc..)
6. Check for missing values in the dataset to avoid inaccuracy, biased results, etc..
7. Removal of unecessary data unrelated to desired analysis (Example: Index) by utilizing various methods(Example: Correlation Matrix)
8. Data reengineering to inverse initial numeric value
9. Convert data type of "Gender" to String value in order to define gender type
10. Checking for outliers to avoid inaccurate results
11. Visualization & analysis conducted to find contributing factors to Lung Cancer categorized by Lung Cancer Severity
